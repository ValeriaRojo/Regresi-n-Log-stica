Thanks for looking up my listing, I hope you like what you see.

The home was built in 1910, it is large, welcoming and clean. 
It  has 3 stories, 6 bedrooms, 3 bathrooms & multiple common areas. Plenty of room to socialize if you wish so, or to keep to oneself if preferred. 
Whatever you do, please be kind, clean and considerate. 

I typically spend my week days in Boston and my weekends in Providence. When not in Boston or Providence, I can be found on photo assignments around New England or playing with pups! When not playing with pups, on assignments or hosting, I may be found roaming the the world. My favorite part of the world is South East Asia (I've spent multiple Winters in Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia, Japan, China, Myanmar, India, The Philippines and Indonesia to name a few ;)). More recent trips have taken me to Guadeloupe, Panama, Colombia and various other Central and South American countries. I grew up in Europe and speak French, Spanish and English and understand, or have notions of, a few other languages. I love discovering new cultures & meeting new people. 

I started hosting in 2016 and I’m loving it and  the chance to meet & host people from all corners of the world and walk of life! 

Your comfort & happiness under my roof (and out of the home) during your visit are very important to me; I always thrive to please my guests and, hopefully, surpass their expectations whenever I can! :) 

I adore pets and occasionally swing by with a furry friend or two. I allow up to two pet guests at a time. Please do not book with me if you have allergies or do not enjoy sharing your home with pets. I may or may not have furry friends during your visit. 

It is important to me that my guests are clean, kind, mature, considerate, respectful and friendly. No party, no loud anything and no smoking at the home please. Music/musicians and fun conversations are always welcome on the other end (but not expected). 

I look forward to hearing from you and hopefully hosting you soon; don't hesitate to reach out or ask anything. :) ",within a few hours,100%,33%,1.0,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/User-57812241/original/396e9437-1575-4f64-a27b-28860c9052e1.jpeg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/User-57812241/original/396e9437-1575-4f64-a27b-28860c9052e1.jpeg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,,10,19,"['email', 'phone']",1,1,Neighborhood highlights,Dorchester,42.31974,-71.05734,Private room in rental unit,Private room,2,1.0,1 shared bath,1.0,1.0,"[""Smoke alarm"", ""Ethernet connection"", ""Coffee maker"", ""Hangers"", ""Stove"", ""Carbon monoxide alarm"", ""Oven"", ""Dryer"", ""Fire extinguisher"", ""Host greets you"", ""Extra pillows and blankets"", ""Essentials"", ""Air conditioning"", ""Heating"", ""Cooking basics"", ""Free street parking"", ""Wifi"", ""Microwave"", ""Bed linens"", ""Kitchen"", ""Refrigerator"", ""Hair dryer"", ""TV with standard cable"", ""Free parking on premises"", ""Dishes and silverware"", ""Washer"", ""Patio or balcony"", ""Shampoo"", ""Backyard"", ""Iron"", ""Dishwasher"", ""Hot water""]",135.0,91,288,91.0,91.0,288.0,288.0,91.0,288.0,t,0,0,0,0,2024-12-20,4,0,0,2017-11-19,2018-07-01,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.75,5.0,,0,1,0,1,0,0.05

I have taken the same approach we took at my previous firm to managing our personal real estate investments, by providing exceptional service combined with fantastic accommodations in prime locations.

I believe that wasting time is a good thing, we are overscheduled, overinvolved, and overstretched. Traveling allows me to kick back and go to museum just because. Or sit in café, if I am too tired for a museum, or do both.
My favorite city is Barcelona, although Boston great, too, and so is Buxtehude, my home town in Germany. I believe you can find beautiful things in almost all cities, and in the end it is more about whom you travel with and whom you meet. 
My girlfriend and I just started hosting, but already had guests from many parts of the world.

Many wise people have said many wise things. There is a German saying ""If you say A, you also have to say B"", which is to say that you have to follow through if you have started something. Einstein responded to that: ""If you say A, you don't need to say B, you can also see that A was wrong"". How about that for humbleness of an atheist.

I like to refer to myself as a retired elementary teacher although I spent the last quarter of my career as an administrator.  But my teaching years were my best.  The daily student teacher interaction, the laughter and frustrations, the little signs of progress, made the work so fulfilling.

I grew up on a very successful produce and dairy farm in Southeastern Massachusetts.  Our main cash crop was tomatoes but we raised all kinds of vegetables.  They were trucked into Boston.  In the winter the dairy supported us.  My childhood exposed me to hard work but also to a love for the outdoors and nature.

Out of college I worked for the Department of Defense as a teacher in their overseas dependents' schools.  I taught in Istanbul and Seville, Spain.  I was able to travel extensively through Europe for three years.

Upon returning to the States I began teaching in Quincy, Massachusetts, where I remained for thirty years.  The last seven years were spent as a principal of an elementary school which has a majority population of Asian students.  I traveled to China one summer to explore my students' heritage and culture.

In the interim I married Joyce Brothers.  Joyce is a case manager for Boston Senior Home Care.  Her passion is cooking and she is a graduate of the Cambridge School of Culinary Arts.

She and I have raised two children.  Our daughter is a school teacher.  Our son, born in Brazil, is a hair stylist.

I'm originally from Spain but I've been in JP for almost 26 years when work and study brought me to Boston.  I love traveling and exploring different cultures.  I also love being outdoors especially riding my bike around town or walking my very friendly small dog, Henri.  He is hypoallergenic and he does not shed.  He lives on the second floor but if you met him you'd want him to visit you.  Henri is adorable and lovable!  He is like a teddy bear.
I'm a food enthusiast concentrating on natural and organic foods but I'm not a purist so I'm flexible and adjust to different situations where organic is not available.  I, must say my favorite food is a slice of good bread dipped in olive oil (of course from Spain lol).
I can offer a warm and comforting atmosphere, a home away from home.   I'd be glad to help you to get around the city, where to eat, finding bike paths in the city., etc. 

I have hosted with Air BnB since 2016 with an hiatus in 2019.  I have 17+ years of hosting in my victorian house through various universities in Boston.  I have hosted for short and  long periods many medical researchers, medical visitors, visiting professors, high tech, artists, English learners etc from all over the world.  
House is between Green line (MSPCA stop) and Orange Line (Stony Brook).  Ten min walk to Whole Foods.  My  house is 2 miles to Harvard School of Medicine, Longwood Medical area, Northeastern and a bit further but not far the medical campus of Boston University, 10 min T ride from Back Bay where you can find The Arquitectural School and MFA is 2.3 miles away.

Prior to my current job at an investment consulting and advisory firm, where I focus on identifying top-tier real estate managers for our clients to invest in, I worked for a small firm managing a Saudi Prince's hotel investments across North America and Europe.  We managed his interests in the Four Seasons and Fairmont, as well as oversaw his investments in several trophy properties, most notably, NYC's The Plaza; Paris' Four Seasons Hotel George V; and London's The Savoy.  I have taken the same approach we took at my previous firm to managing our personal real estate investments, by providing exceptional service combined with fantastic accommodations in prime locations.

I believe that wasting time is a good thing, we are overscheduled, overinvolved, and overstretched. Traveling allows me to kick back and go to museum just because. Or sit in café, if I am too tired for a museum, or do both.
My favorite city is Barcelona, although Boston great, too, and so is Buxtehude, my home town in Germany. I believe you can find beautiful things in almost all cities, and in the end it is more about whom you travel with and whom you meet.

Many wise people have said many wise things. There is a German saying ""If you say A, you also have to say B"", which is to say that you have to follow through if you have started something. Einstein responded to that: ""If you say A, you don't need to say B, you can also see that A was wrong"". How about that for humbleness of an atheist.

My name is Michael (my friends call me Misha) I live in Boston MA. I am friendly, outgoing, and love to meet new people. I welcome suggestions and am always looking to make my guest's experiences as enjoyable as possible. If there is anything I can do to improve your stay, just ask! 
I travel a lot and since discovering the Airbnb option I much prefer to stay in the real houses/apartments then in hotels. I think through the Airbnb experience you get to enjoy much more the local atmosphere, getting more unique experience and much better vibe about different mentalities and cities. 
I'm very respectful of other people houses and try to leave as less of a ""footprint"" as possible. I'm very eager to share our properties with our guests.
